# **Work Day Scheduler**
 
## **Project Description**

This web application is meant to help users organize their work days by allowing them to log and refer back to various to-do tasks throughout a typical 9m - 5pm work day.   

## **How to Use the Project**

Start by typing a task into one of the input fields on the web application. Then click the adjacent blue save button to have that information logged into the browser and stored for the next time you're looking to refer to it. Fill in as many input fields as you would like the app to keep track of. Once the current time of day (i.e. 10AM, 11AM, 12PM) is past what is listed on the web app, the corresponding time block will gray-out until the nect 24-hour cycle. Present times with feature a red background and future events represent green events.
